Language:	JOVIAL (J73)
Version:	1.2
Maintainer:	Paul McGinnis <paulmcg@aol.com>
Last Change:	2011/06/17

Supported file suffixes: *.j73, *.jov, *.jovial

This archive contains Vim syntax highlighting for the JOVIAL programming language.

It's designed for the J73 dialect (MIL-STD-1589C), but works with other
versions. A simple piece of JOVIAL code can be found in the file sample.j73.
After installation, you should be able to open that file with Vim and get
color syntax highlighting.

For more information about JOVIAL, please see:

I have uploaded a copy of MIL-STD-1589C to:

INSTALLATION
============
This archive contains two directories, ftdetect and syntax. Each directory has
a file called jovial.vim. Copy both directories into ~/.vim, where ~ is your
home directory.
