Supported file suffixes: *.j73, *.jov, *.jovial

This archive contains Vim syntax highlighting for the JOVIAL programming language.

It's designed for the J73 dialect (MIL-STD-1589C), but works with other versions. A simple piece of JOVIAL code can be found in the file sample.j73. After installation, you should be able to open that file with Vim and get color syntax highlighting.

For more information about JOVIAL, please see:

I have uploaded a copy of MIL-STD-1589C to:
